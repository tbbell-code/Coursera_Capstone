Furthermore, the consensus at a recent community board meeting determined Dobbs Ferry Animal Hospital in Dobbs Ferry, New York to be the closest agreed upon pet care center of choice; albeit difficult to get to without renting or borrowing a vehicle. In addition, residents agreed that services such as Uber/Lyft employee drivers reluctant to transport animals to appointments. And to top it off, the MTA (New York City Transit) forbids animals on the subway with the exception of service pets thereby leaving residents few transportation options. So, one resident proposed that the community board members pool their resources to lure a top veterinarian to the local area to open an animal hospital which is high quality and nearby. ",
